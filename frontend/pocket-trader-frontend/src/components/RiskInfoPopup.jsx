            <strong>üìâ Short-Term Volatility:</strong> A higher value means the
            stock's daily prices vary more dramatically‚Äîoften considered riskier
            in the short run. A lower value suggests the stock's price changes
            are relatively smaller day-to-day, implying more stability (but not
            necessarily better performance). <br />
            <strong>How it's calculated:</strong>
            <ul style={{}}>
              <li>
                We fetch the stock's closing prices from the last 30 days
                (roughly 1 month).
              </li>
              <li>
                We compute the daily returns: how much the price changes from
                one day to the next, in percentage terms.
                <li>
                  <code>
                    daily_return = (Close(i) - Close(i-1)) / Close(i-1)
                  </code>
                </li>
              </li>
              <li>
                We calculate the standard deviation (œÉ) of those daily returns.
                This metric is commonly called volatility in finance.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>‚ö†Ô∏è Short-Term Risk Level:</strong> Categorizes stock risk as
            Low, Medium, or High based on volatility.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>üìà Long-Term Trend (Slope):</strong> A positive slope means
            the stock‚Äôs price has generally increased over the past year (an
            uptrend). A negative slope means the price has generally decreased
            (a downtrend).
            <br />
            <strong>How it's calculated:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>
                We fetch the stock's closing prices from the last 365 days
                (roughly 1 year).
              </li>
              <li>We fit a linear regression line to the closing prices.</li>
              <li>
                The slope of this line tells us the stock's long-term trend.
              </li>
            </ul>
